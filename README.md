Modern-MEAN is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.

modern-mean-core is the essential building block for your application, the core functionality of Modern-MEAN! We are planning on releasing additional modules at a later point in our development and maturity of Modern-MEAN. Modules will have their own repository and/or be branched off the modern-mean-core.

One of main goals is to always be current, be it by features, by dependencies, or by community input! Let's make this the last and best script you have been looking for! Happy coding!


## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a SHACKAPP application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
  * Node v5.x is REQUIRED!
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Ruby - [Download & Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Gulp - You may use Gulp for Live Reload, Linting, and SASS or LESS.

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp
```
## Downloading Modern-MEAN
There are several ways you can get the Modern-MEAN boilerplate:


### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get Modern-MEAN is to use git to directly clone the Modern-MEAN repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/modern-mean/modern-mean-core.git modern-mean
```

This will clone the latest version of the Modern-MEAN repository to a **modern-mean** folder.


### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the Modern-MEAN boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/modern-mean/modern-mean-core/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/modern-mean/modern-mean-core/archive/master.zip -O modern-mean-core.zip; unzip modern-mean-core.zip; rm modern-mean-core.zip
```

Don't forget to rename **modern-mean-core-master** after your project name.


## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your Modern-MEAN application.

The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application. To learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.

To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application


## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Gulp, just run Gulp default task:

```
$ gulp
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options


### Running with User Seed
To have default account(s) seeded at runtime:

In Development:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true gulp
```
It will try to seed the users 'user' and 'admin'. If one of the user already exists, it will display an error message on the console. Just grab the passwords from the console.

In Production:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true gulp prod
```
This will seed the admin user one time if the user does not already exist. You have to copy the password from the console and save it.


### Running with TLS (SSL)
Application will start by default with secure configuration (SSL mode) turned on and listen on port 8443.
To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following command:

```bash
$ sh ./scripts/generate-ssl-certs.sh
```

Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority).
After you've generated the key and certificate, place them in the *config/sslcerts* folder.

Finally, execute gulp's prod task `gulp prod`
* enable/disable SSL mode in production environment change the `secure` option in `config/env/production.js`


## Running your application with Gulp

After the install process, you can easily run your project with:

```bash
$ gulp
```
or

```bash
$ gulp default
```

The server is now running on http://localhost:3000 if you are using the default settings.


### Running Gulp Development Environment

Start the development environment with:

```bash
$ gulp dev
```


### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute gulp as follows:

```bash
$ gulp prod
```


### Testing Your Application with Gulp
Using the full test suite included with Modern-MEAN with the test task:

### Run all tests
```bash
$ gulp test
```

### Run server tests
```bash
gulp test:server
```

### Run client tests
```bash
gulp test:client
```

### Run e2e tests
```bash
gulp test:e2e
```


## Getting Started With Modern-MEAN
You have your application running, but there is a lot of stuff to understand. We recommend you go over the Official Documentation *under construction*.
In the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of Modern-MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep it updated by your request. You can also help us develop and improve the documentation by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.
